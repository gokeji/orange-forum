My forum is called the orange forum.

All requested functions are working, including displaying the information, forum stats, breadcrumb navigation, pagination, post new topics and posts, login to facebook, and error handling.

The data within the sql database are not all correct, since some are created within the mysql database, and the post/topic numbers may not match up with the actual numbers. 
However, if posts were made within the forum, those numbers will update correctly. 

There is error checking code for invalid forum id, in case the user types in an invalid number in the url.Empty fields while posting will also be prompted.
